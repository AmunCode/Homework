# Homework
Discord Channel: https://discord.gg/gxEa2csX , I will be there most weekday evenings. 
Coding challenges to help develop Python skills. Use https://replit.com/~ to code. Later on we'll switch to a proper IDE. For now Replit will allow you to invite other people to see your code and share a workspace. I also advise creating a github repository for each challenge. 

# Week 1 challenges I:
  - Create 12 variables that describe you as a person.
    Be sure to use a mix of date types like Strings, Floats, Integers, and Booleans. Print out the variables.
  
  - Print out a paragraph using the variable and text. For example it one of your variable is 'age' print something like 'I am 24 years old'. But the variable must be      used in printing. Try to use all of your variable to tell me about yourself in the output. Resource for print(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp

  - Ask user 12 questions and collect each user input into a variable. Then print 12 statements using the user variables. For example, you could ask the use for their eye color. Once you get to the printing part you would print something like this: 'Your eye color is green". Resource for input(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp

# Week 1 challenges II: 
  - Create a text based game that makes decision based on the player input. This will require storing the user input and then using that input to make decisions in the game. You most likely need to use comparison operators. I advise making a hand written diagram of your game before you begin coding. This should hurt a little bit, thatâ€™s is how we learn. Reach out if you have issues.

# Week 2 Challenges I:
  - Write a program that takes in number grade and print out a letter grade. For example, 95 would an 'A', 76 would be a C, anything below 60 would be an 'F'. 
    90 - 100 = A ,80 - 89  = B, 70 - 79  = C,60 - 69  = D, <60 = F. Hint: you will need to convert the input into a number.
    
  - Write a program that will take in the users first name and the users last name. The program will them print out the user initials. In my case, 'G J' would be the output.

  - Write a program that will add up every number in a range from 1-20 (inclusive). The program will print out the total.
  - Write a program that will take in 4 numbers from a user. The program will then print the higest number the user entered and the lowest number the user entered.
    for example if the user entered '40, 4000, -4554, 78', your program should print out "your max number: 4000" and "your min number: -4554".
    
  - Write a program that take in two numbers from a user and return the sum of those two numbers. you must use an function called 'add' and pass the tow numbers to the add function. Then print the sum out to the user. So if I entered 60 and 55, I should get a print out of 115. 

# Week 2 Challenges II:
  - Write a calculator. A program that will let the user enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) to be performed on the given numbers. The results of the calculation should be printed on the screen. 
  - BONUS (HARD) - Make a variation of your calculator program that allows the user to continue to make calculations until the choose to exit. This mean I could enter 10 + 15 = 25, then do another calculation onto 25. Something like 25 * 4 resulting in 100. HINT: pseudocode this before you start coding, How do you keep doing calculation loops? The team gets treated to lunch is you can hand in a finished code that I cannot break by entering bogus information like 'A B C' or some other bogus information.
