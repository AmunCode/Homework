# Homework
Discord Channel: https://discord.gg/gxEa2csX , I will be there most weekday evenings. 
Coding challenges to help develop Python skills. Use https://replit.com/~ to code. Later on we'll switch to a proper IDE. For now Replit will allow you to invite other people to see your code and share a workspace. I also advise creating a github repository for each challenge. 

# Week 1 challenges I:
  - Create 12 variables that describe you as a person.
    Be sure to use a mix of date types like Strings, Floats, Integers, and Booleans. Print out the variables.
  
  - Print out a paragraph using the variable and text. For example it one of your variable is 'age' print something like 'I am 24 years old'. But the variable must be      used in printing. Try to use all of your variable to tell me about yourself in the output. Resource for print(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp

  - Ask user 12 questions and collect each user input into a variable. Then print 12 statements using the user variables. For example, you could ask the use for their eye color. Once you get to the printing part you would print something like this: 'Your eye color is green". Resource for input(): https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp

# Week 1 challenges II: 
  - Create a text based game that makes decision based on the player input. This will require storing the user input and then using that input to make decisions in the game. You most likely need to use comparison operators. I advise making a hand written diagram of your game before you begin coding. This should hurt a little bit, thatâ€™s is how we learn. Reach out if you have issues.

# Week 2 Challenges I:
  - Write a program that takes in number grade and print out a letter grade. For example, 95 would an 'A', 76 would be a C, anything below 60 would be an 'F'. 
    90 - 100 = A ,80 - 89  = B, 70 - 79  = C,60 - 69  = D, <60 = F. Hint: you will need to convert the input into a number.
    
  - Write a program that will take in the users first name and the users last name. The program will them print out the user initials. In my case, 'G J' would be the output.

  - Write a program that will add up every number in a range from 1-20 (inclusive). The program will print out the total.
